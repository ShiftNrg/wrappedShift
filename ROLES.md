# Capped Role
* Utilized to adjust the cap of the wSHIFT smart contract as a redundancy to not allow minting more than the actual supply sourced from the Lisk-based ShiftNrg Blockchain. 

# Burner Role
* Utilized to enable burning tokens, in the future, when the migration bridge is live to Substrate Shift.

# Mintable Role
* Utilized to mint tokens, typically in batches, to individuals migrating from Lisk-based Shift to Wrapped Shift.

# Pauser Role
* Utilized to pause transfers incase an emergency occurred that required such actions. Better safe than sorry.
